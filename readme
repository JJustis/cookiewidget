on admin.php can you make a social system out of cookies where users collect eachothers cookies each time they are on the same post and lookup simular and same words both in the admin.php and index.php hosting the widget and latest widget post in the widget and make the name of the cookie more elaboraate with each siteing, so if 24 people are on the page then 24 cookies aare shared on each users cookie storage, each time a user comes back in contact with another who has the same cookie in cache makes the next cookie between the 2 more elaborate includeing a system for buying encryption of the cookie using aes so users can play a game of hide and seek together, using the IPN from paypal to do this, with a shop for encryption, comppression, and base 64 encoding using a virtual currency like a reserve systemwhich can be purchased or earned by comleteing proof of work as dsa with blockchain technology rewards to wallets made on register, rewards start at 100 cookie relationships bundeled into a structured list that acts as a digital package for signage, the system uses workers on each users visit to "mine" all issued cookies into bundles that are the same === as the bundle received from one user, so a serise of attempts at remaking the bundel from the public roster of cookies and their saved data is made to cause a proof of work scheme on digital signage of the bundle package once it's found on the public database (implementing a proof of work scheme that is more traditional here after bundle recreation and receival)= 100 cryptotokens
The second part is a widget with a navbar for logging in or registering, under the most recent post on the site from the users who have accounts, a post is a word grouping as a head line which stitches together word information from the database about word(s) in the title of the widget on admin.php 
1, On word lookup a cookie is issued to the user with a title that is a uniqueID with purchasedIpn($upgrade//"submit upgrade code purchased on the admin page to unlock cookie protections") filled in with the words looked up on it.
2, On widget creation there is a cookie issued with the same uniqueID filled with the purchasedIpn($upgrade//"submit upgrade code purchased on the admin page to unlock cookie protections") filled in with the words posted on it.
3, On search of a word in the search bar of widget on the index.php the user gets another cookie with the same uniqueID with the purchasedIpn($upgrade//"submit upgrade code purchased on the admin page to unlock cookie protections") filled in with the words searched on it.
4, On reaction (clicking any of the widgets buttons or expanding the length to full screen) give yet another cookie with the same uniqueID as is created on login
5, every second the browser is told by a worker running, to bundle up active users requested cookies useing the uniqueId set in the session data to sign the bundle with as well on verification of a bundles legitamacy through the following: on bundle creation create a blockchain block with the name of as the uniqueId hashed sha256, the worker attempts to then recreate the block with all cookie issuances by hashing the issuances with matching uniqueIds' until a match is made between the hash created and the block name, so in every order possible.
6, use a traditional proof of work system on top of the main blockchain as blockchain2, when two are matching make a transaction from the bank (stored block rewards made by the centralized system) in the traditional proof of work scheme to the user who submitted the cookie bundle in this case 1.2 cryptotokens.
7, make a traditional transaction system for purchasing virtual currency from the bank, as stores of value certificates
